Web AWR Tools Version 1.0

AWR dump warehouse with web-based UI.

The main aims are:
1) to have some user-friendly interface to manipulate with AWR dumps (load, store, comment, unload).
2) to create customized reports from raw AWR data using user-friendly interface, Currently, there are "SQL queries compare report" and "Sysmetric report".
3) to share scripts with command-line AWR Tools. Exact the same main scripts are used in both tools.
4) to be able to analyze AWR dumps which contain overlapping snapshot ranges (relevant to a situation when FLASHBACK DATABASE is in use for testing different scenarios).

Setup

1. Prepare two database instances on the same host. First one must have APEX 5 installed.
2. Edit file server/awrtools.sql put connect string of the second database instance to dblink create statement.
3. Both instances must have access to a directory (/u01/app/oracle/files/awrdata/ by default). Edit files setup/sys_setup.sql and setup/remote_setup.sql to change it.
4. Connect to the first database as sysdba, execute script setup/sys_setup.sql.
5. Connect to the second database as sysdba, execute script setup/remote_setup.sql.
6. Change dir to server, connect to the first database as awrtools user (password is the same by default) and execute awrtools.sql.
7. Connect to the second database with remawrtools user (password is the same by default) and execute remawrtools.sql.

Use-cases:
1. Create a project.
2. Load two or more raw AWR dumps.
3. Load dumps into AWR repository, if snapshot ranges are overlapping, load the second dump into the second (remote) database.
4. Create reports (the are stored automatically).
5. Archive project: unload AWR data from AWR repository for dumps. Can be loaded in the future.
6. Compress project: unload AWR data from AWR repository for dumps. Delete AWR dumps from database storage. Only created reports will remain available.
