Web AWR Tools. Ver 2.1

AWR dump warehouse with web-based UI.

The main aims are:
1) to have some user-friendly interface to manipulate AWR dumps (load, store, comment, unload).
2) to create customized reports from raw AWR data using user-friendly interface, Currently, there are two custom reports "SQL queries compare report (HTML)" and "AWR SQL Report (HTML)" and all standard AWR reports.
3) to share scripts with command-line AWR Tools. Exact the same main scripts are used for both tools.
4) to be able to analyze AWR dumps which contain overlapping snapshot ranges (relevant to a situation when FLASHBACK DATABASE is in use for testing different scenarios).

Setup

1. Prepare two database instances on the same host. First one must have APEX 5 installed.
2. Edit file install/install_config.sql. Write all necessary parameters. Local database is that with APEX installed.
   - both instances must have access to a directory which is used for temporary storage of a dump file (/u01/app/oracle/files/awrdata/ by default)
3. Make "install" as a current directory.
4. Execute the following scripts in the mentioned sequence:

@install

5. Check logs for errors. Fix it if exists and rerun the same script sequence.
7. Install APEX application apexapp/f200.sql, use workspace attached to local user (see item 2 of this instruction).

Uninstall
1. Make sure the file install/install_config.sql contains correct configuration for uninstalled system.
2. Run the following script:

@uninstall

Use-cases:
1. Create a project.
2. Load two or more raw AWR dumps.
3. Load dumps into AWR repository, if snapshot ranges are overlapping, load the second dump into the second (remote) database.
4. Create reports (the are stored automatically).
5. Compress dump: Delete a dump file from database storage. AWR data is available for analysis.
6. Unload AWR range: unload AWR data from AWR repository for a dump. AWR data can be loaded in the future if the dump file is still in the database.
